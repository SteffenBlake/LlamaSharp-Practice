# Llamasharp Practice

Principles Practiced:

1. Utilizing [.NET Aspire](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/get-started/aspire-overview) to scaffold up a multi service/resource app stack with a manageable dashboard (Status: Complete âœ…)

2. Loading of a configured `.gguf` llama.cpp model for inference / text generation (Status: Complete âœ…)

3. Generating a vector database from imported files, including support for indexing and tagging of the data (Status: Complete âœ…)

4. Saving aforementioned vector database automatically on generation (Status: Complete âœ…)

5. Loading and usage of vector database for Retrieval Augmented based Generation (RAG) protocol (Status: Complete âœ…)

6. Setting up HTTP (SignalR?) API for interacting with model through Aspire (Status: WIP ðŸš§)

7. Configuring usable Model Context Protocols (Status: WIP ðŸš§)

8. Injecting MCP definitions for invocation by Model (Status: WIP ðŸš§))

9. Parsing of model generated data for trigger of MCP's (Status: WIP ðŸš§))

10. Returning back MCP's results to context, for further consumption by model (Status: WIP ðŸš§))
